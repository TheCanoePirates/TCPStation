  GoldenAlpharex:
  - refactor: Refactored the way the undertile component works, to allow it to have
      a bit more granularity as to when it's meant to be covered, but still visible,
      like for catwalks!
  - bugfix: Catwalks no longer are affected by ambient occlusion, and now properly
      feel like actual floor tiles.
  Melbert:
  - refactor: Refactored deep fried foods. Deep fried foods are still ""usable"" as
      their normal item, but are just edible.
  - qol: Silver Slime stuff can spawn grilled as well as fried.

  - rscadd: Shaft Miner's equipment vendor now orders their equipment through the
