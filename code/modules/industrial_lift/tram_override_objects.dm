/**
 * the tram has a few objects mapped onto it at roundstart, by default many of those objects have unwanted properties
 * for example grilles and windows have the atmos_sensitive element applied to them, which makes them register to
 * themselves moving to re register signals onto the turf via connect_loc. this is bad and dumb since it makes the tram
 * more expensive to move.
 *
 * if you map something on to the tram, make SURE if possible that it doesnt have anythign reacting to its own movement
 * it will make the tram more expensive to move and we dont want that because we dont want to return to the days where
 * the tram took a third of the tick per movement when its just carrying its default mapped in objects
